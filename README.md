# SolDrive

Soldrive is Descentralized File Sharing Platform.

# How to run it ?

First, you need to duplicate the .env.example file, and name it .env, and you should be good to go.
Change value depending on your needs, but project should work with just the defaults.
Make sure you have the indexing server running locally, which will make the request run correctly through the app. To run the indexing server, please read instructions in its corresponding repository at [soldrive-indexer](https://github.com/olyvialabs/indexer-soldrive)

After setting the environment, and having the base servers running locally, you would just need to run:

```ts
yarn dev
```
